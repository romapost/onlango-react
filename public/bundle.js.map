It uses\r\n * modern `flexbox` for layout making it super responsive and performant. Leaving most of the layout heavy lifting\r\n * to the browser. __note:__ The default styles use `height: 100%` which means your container must set an explicit\r\n * height (feel free to adjust the styles to suit your specific needs).\r\n *\r\n * Big Calendar is unopiniated about editing and moving events, prefering to let you implement it in a way that makes\r\n * the most sense to your app. It also tries not to be prescriptive about your event data structures, just tell it\r\n * how to find the start and end datetimes and you can pass it whatever you want.\r\n *\r\n * One thing to note is that, `react-big-calendar` treats event start/end dates as an _exclusive_ range.\r\n * which means that the event spans up to, but not including, the end date. In the case\r\n * of displaying events on whole days, end dates are rounded _up_ to the next day. So an\r\n * event ending on `Apr 8th 12:00:00 am` will not appear on the 8th, whereas one ending\r\n * on `Apr 8th 12:01:00 am` will. If you want _inclusive_ ranges consider providing a\r\n * function `endAccessor` that returns the end date + 1 day for those events that end at midnight.\r\n */\nvar Calendar = _react2.default.createClass({\n  displayName: 'Calendar',\n\n\n  propTypes: {\n\n    /**\r\n     * Props passed to main calendar `<div>`.\r\n     */\n    elementProps: _react.PropTypes.object,\n\n    /**\r\n     * The current date value of the calendar.

dialog stacking when one-at-a-time just isn't enough.\n * - Creates a backdrop, for disabling interaction below the modal.\n * - It properly manages focus; moving to the modal content, and keeping it there until the modal is closed.\n * - It disables scrolling of the page content while open.\n * - Adds the appropriate ARIA roles are automatically.\n * - Easily pluggable animations via a `<Transition/>` component.\n *\n * Note that, in the same way the backdrop element prevents users from clicking or interacting\n * with the page content underneath the Modal, Screen readers also need to be signaled to not to\n * interact with page content while the Modal is open. To do this, we use a common technique of applying\n * the `aria-hidden='true'` attribute to the non-Modal elements in the Modal `container`.
